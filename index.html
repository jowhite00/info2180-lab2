                        <p>A slippery slope argument, in logic, critical thinking, 
                            political rhetoric, and caselaw, is often viewed as a logical fallacy in which a party asserts that a relatively small first step leads to a chain of 
                            related events culminating in some significant effect.</p>
                        
                        <p>In other words, the slippery slope fallacy is when you take one mild negative consequence 
                            and tie it with a similar but extreme negative consequence and then argue that one will lead to the other. 
                            You see this fallacy show up in all sorts of places, especially within business organizations, foreign policy
                            , and yes, paranoid parenting.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post #2: Red Herrings</h2>

                    <img class="article_img2" src="red.png" alt="This is a picture of Hitler"> 
                    </div>    
                    <div> 
                        <p>Red Herrings are arguments that seem relevant to an issue but actually are not. For example, we could be arguing about whether being vegetarian is more ethical than eating meat. Then, in the middle of a perfectly fine argument, 
                            I blurt out, “Well, Hitler was vegetarian! And he surely wasn’t ethical!”
                            This is a distraction from the real point of debate: whether eating meat is inherently unethical. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>These kinds of distractions from the argument are known as “red herrings.” 
                            And if you—god forbid—spend lots of time watching and reading the news, 
                            you will notice a large proportion of what is said and written is some form of a red herring.</p>
